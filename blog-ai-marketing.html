        <p>Marketing in the digital world is constantly evolving. It can seem tough to keep up with new trends, tools, and tactics. But worry not, because AI is here! It’s 2024, ya folks!! It can seamlessly assist you in streamlining your workflows, personalize content for your audience, and reveal helpful data insights. With ChatGPT, Copilot, Google-Gemini, Search Marketing has transcended boundaries, in fact the whole of digital marketing! How exciting!</p>

        <h2>Leveraging AI in Digital Marketing</h2>
        <p>For starters, AI can help analyse customer behaviour, using predictive analytics too – predict outcomes, streamlines several workflow processes in a jiffy!</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-marketing" target="_blank">HubSpot</a>, the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-marketing" target="_blank">top 3 uses of AI in Digital Marketing</a> are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data Analysis / Reporting</li>
    <li>Research / Article Summaries</li>
    <li>Content Creation</li>
</ul>


        <h2>Leveraging AI in Content Marketing</h2>
        <p>Any digital marketing strategy relies on high-quality content. But consistently creating freshly engaging written content can continually present several challenges.</p>

        <p>As a content marketer, I would agree that “AI cannot completely replace a human in content creation”. I usually use it to ideate topics, draft content outlines, or garner some secondary research sources.</p>

        <p>Also, it’s not that Google has blacklisted AI content, but there are certain metrics to follow to get ranked high on the SERP. Using content humanizing tools WILL NOT replace human-created content. One would be using AI to replace another AI. I have performed my own testing too. Also, I have written a bit more about this further down the article, about how Google is looking to deepen the SE positive experiences, one of that being personalization and conversational search.</p>

        <p>AI can skim competitor content and trends, providing ample resources to plan your content strategy.</p>

        <h2>AI in Social Media Marketing</h2>
        <p>Schedule posts across many platforms using AI. Then see which ones get the most engagement. That way, you’ll know what resonates best. The Meta group, for no doubt, has to be on top of this list, in <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/facebook-feed-improvements-ai-show-more-less/" target="_blank">spearheading</a> the AI revolution on social media.</p>

        <p>In my personal opinion, X (formerly Twitter) is the worst in this department. The platform seems to not attract many businesses as before, and that’s a boost for LinkedIn. Here are a few general instances where AI can benefit social media:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Caption generation using skillful prompting</li>
            <li>AI assistance in videos, audios, and images</li>
            <li>Campaign concept ideas</li>
            <li>Designing creative assets, and more</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For a quick glance, here’s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nEZEvCb5u_OFGciZ9vvSmFKHwOAS1hOIqrhZm5L80dE/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">table</a> compiled on various social media platforms and how their AI features benefit users. Mind you, it will have to get updated from time to time. With video content getting more popular than ever, almost a compulsion now, most new AI features are related to video creation.</p>

        <h2>SEO & AI: What’s Up?</h2>
        <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) and paid advertising together charge your traffic up in so little-yet-much time. Here’s another <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aoPNXAq_Ceouc8IsMVJunMbHvqv6b7tafwwPYrL0u1o/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">table</a> (will also be updated, is more like draft 1), of the various AI features usable in SEO activities. As of now, I will be focusing on organic tasks only.</p>

        <p>So, what can AI do to improve our SEO lives?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generate content ideas</li>
            <li>Website performance analysis</li>
            <li>Speed up keyword research process</li>
            <li>Content optimization – Voice Search</li>
            <li>Backlink Analyses</li>
            <li>Schema markup creation</li>
            <li>Predict user intent and behavior</li>
            <li>UX personalization and many more</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ethics and Conclusion</h2>
        <p>There’s no doubting that AI is revolutionizing the world. But what about ethical considerations? That’s an aspect where there must be balance and boundaries not overstepped. It can create serious legal repercussions, such as breaching data privacy, bias in models, security, accountability, deep fakes, etc. AI is bringing out several new challenges in time, and with each of those, a new solution needs to be agreed upon as well.</p>
